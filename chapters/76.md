## 76 – Gentle Discernment of Desire

Yet, children, not every tear and every ache comes from God. Some sorrows come from the body, from weariness, or from a tender heart that weeps easily. These, too, deserve kindness—but they must not be confused with divine fire.

When God’s love moves the soul, the pain is sweet and steady. It brings peace even while it burns. But when sorrow comes from weakness or imagination, it agitates and exhausts the spirit.

So be gentle with yourselves. Let love grow, but do not force the flame.

**Breath Prayer**  
> *Kindle what is true.*
