## 83 – Stay With the Wounded Love

Children, do not leave Jesus in His humanity. His wounds, His tears, His Mother, and His saints are not beneath spiritual prayer—they are its living doorway.

Even when God lifts the soul into quiet or light, He is pleased when we pause to grieve with Christ, to sit beside Him in His pain. Consolations come and go, but His love in suffering remains a steady path.

If anyone tells you that you no longer need this holy companionship, be gentle—but do not follow them.

**Breath Prayer**  
> *I stay with You.*
