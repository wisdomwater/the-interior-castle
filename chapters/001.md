## 1 - A Will That Consents

I begin, dear soul, not because I feel strong, but because Love has asked. My head is full of noise, my body tired, my heart unsure. And yet something gentler than fear keeps nudging me forward. Obedience, when it is given to God, does not crush us—it carries us.

You may think you must feel ready before you say yes to prayer, to silence, to this inward journey. But I have learned that God does not wait for our readiness. He only waits for our willingness. Even a trembling yes opens a door in the soul.

So I sit here, weak and unsure, trusting that what is needed will be given as it is needed. You, too, may come just as you are. The castle does not demand perfection—only that you step inside.

**Breath Prayer**
