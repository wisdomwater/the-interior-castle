## 12 – Love Is the Measure

My children, the devil’s chief aim is not always to frighten you with obvious evil, but to cool your charity and thin your affection for one another. For if love grows cold, the whole house grows dim, and even good works lose their fragrance.

Understand this well: true perfection is very simple. It is love of God and love of neighbor. Everything else—Rule, Constitutions, practices—exists only to help us keep these two commandments with greater freedom and fidelity.

So do not let your heart become sharp. If you must correct, do it in the right way and to the right person, with a clean intention. And be careful not to turn concern into conversation, for detraction steals peace quickly and leaves little light behind.
