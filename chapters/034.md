## 34 – Let the Mill Clack On

My children, you may have thought that holiness would quiet your thoughts, but often the mind keeps clattering like a millstone. Do not be frightened by this noise. The mill can keep turning while the wheat is still being ground.

These wandering thoughts are inevitable. Some come from our frailty, some from our imagination, and some from the enemy’s mischief. But you must not lay the whole burden on your soul, as if you were failing simply because the mind is busy.

So let the mill clack on. Keep working with your will and your understanding, gently and steadily, and do not grieve. God is not offended by your human mind being human.

**Breath Prayer**
> *“I keep going.”*
