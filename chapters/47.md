## 47 – Love That Can Be Seen

We cannot always tell how deeply we love God. But we can see, very clearly, how we love one another. Love that reaches outward is the truest mirror of love that rises within.

When the heart grows tender toward others, God gently expands our love for Him. These two loves grow together like branches from one root.

If you wish to know how far you have come, look not to your prayers, but to your patience, your kindness, and your care for those around you.

**Reflection**  
> *How am I loving the people placed before me today?*

**Breath Prayer**  
> *Teach me to love.*
