## 26 – Turning Toward the Light

Some souls walk carefully for many years, yet remain slow and burdened by fear. They wish to please God, but they hesitate to surrender everything. Love, however, longs to run freely.

Do not measure yourself by your carefulness, but by your willingness. Let go of anxious prudence and trust that God will hold you as you move toward Him.

The way is safer when you walk in His light than when you stand still in your own caution.
