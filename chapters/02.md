## 2 - A Work Offered Back to God

> *Light moving through borrowed words*

If anything true appears in these pages, it will not be mine. I am only repeating what I have heard whispered in prayer, what has been placed into me by a Love far greater than my own. I am like a small bird echoing a song it did not invent.

This is how prayer works in all of us. We do not create the light—we let it pass through. We do not generate the fire—we hold still enough to feel its warmth. When you speak to God, even in clumsy or broken words, something holy is already moving beneath them.

So do not worry about being wise or eloquent. Let yourself be simple. Let your heart say what it can. God is skilled at translating even our silence.

**Reflection**

> *What if your quiet, imperfect prayer is already enough?*

**Breath Prayer**

> *Speak through me.*
