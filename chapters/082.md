## 82 – When the Fire Feels Low

There will be days when the flame does not burn and God feels far away. Do not sit and wait as if love must come on its own.

Seek Him gently. Walk with Him in the garden. Stand beside Him at the cross. Let memory and imagination bring Him near until love awakens again.

This is not lesser prayer—it is faithful prayer.

**Breath Prayer**  
> *I seek You still.*
