## 52 – Held by His Hand

Children, if God were to loosen His grip for even a moment, we would fall. So do not trust in your own strength. Ask, again and again, to be held.

Watch gently how you are growing. Notice whether love is widening, whether humility is deepening, whether your daily work is becoming more faithful. These are the signs that show whether you are walking forward or drifting back.

And when danger approaches, God does not remain silent. He whispers warnings in the heart, soft and faithful, to draw you back before you fall.

**Reflection**  
> *Where do I most need to be held by God today?*

**Breath Prayer**  
> *Hold me, O Love.*
