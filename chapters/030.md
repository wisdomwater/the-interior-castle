## 30 – The Peace Beneath the Noise

Your mind may feel like a crowded room, full of noise and movement. Yet beneath all of that, the deeper part of your soul can remain still with God. Do not confuse the restlessness of thought with the absence of prayer.

If you ignore the noise, it loses its power. Whether it comes from weakness, weariness, or fear, it cannot touch the place where God meets you. There, love remains calm.

So stay gently present. The King is not disturbed by the clamor at the door.

**Reflection**
> *What helps you return to the quiet beneath your thoughts?*

**Breath Prayer**
> *“I rest with You.”*
