## 85 – The One Who Walks Beside You

Sometimes, children, Jesus comes so near that the soul knows He is there—without seeing Him, without hearing Him. His presence is quiet, steady, unmistakable.

He stands beside the soul like a companion who never leaves. And from this nearness flows peace, humility, and a tender desire not to displease the One who watches with love.

This presence cannot be forced. It is given. And when it comes, it is more certain than sight.

**Reflection**  
> *What would change in me if I trusted that Christ is already near?*

**Breath Prayer**  
> *You are here.*
