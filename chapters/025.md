## 25 – Learning Through Loss

Sometimes God allows us to feel poor and empty so that we may discover who we truly are. Trials reveal our smallness, but they also open the door to deeper trust. When we cannot rely on ourselves, we lean more honestly on Him.

Do not be dismayed when weakness shows itself. This is not punishment, but medicine. Humility is the ointment that heals every wound.

Let each difficulty teach you how gently God is shaping your heart.

**Reflection**
> *What has recently shown you your need for grace?*

**Breath Prayer**
> *“Heal me, Lord.”*
