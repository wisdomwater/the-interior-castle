## 9 – The Wide Castle

My dear one, do not imagine your soul as small or narrow. It is a vast castle, brighter and more spacious than you could ever conceive. At its center lives the King, and His light reaches into every room, even those you have not yet explored.

You are not meant to stay in one place forever. You may wander freely through these mansions—sometimes resting in self-knowledge, sometimes lifting your gaze to the beauty of God. Both are needed. Humility grows best when it is warmed by wonder.

Let your prayer be like a gentle walking through the house. There is no hurry. Each step is already a gift.
