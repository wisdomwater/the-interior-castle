## 3 - A Castle Made of Light

> *A dwelling bright with hidden glory*

I want you to see your soul, dear one, not as small or broken, but as a castle made of clear crystal, wide and luminous. God delights to live there. Nothing in all creation is as beautiful as the place where He chooses to rest.

You may not feel this beauty, but it is there. Even when the rooms are dusty and the windows clouded, the light still pours through the walls. Your dignity does not come from what you have done, but from the One who made His home in you.

So do not be afraid to look within. You are not entering a ruin, but a palace. Every step inward is a step closer to the heart where God waits in quiet joy.

**Reflection**  
> *What might it change if you believed your soul is a place of divine delight?*

**Breath Prayer**  
> *You dwell in me.*
