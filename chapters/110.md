## 110 — Prayer Is for the Cross

Do not think these favors are given for sweetness alone. God does not draw a soul into deep union merely to comfort it—He draws it near so it may become strong enough to love like His Son. The greatest gift is not pleasure, but a life shaped by Christ: a life that can suffer without bitterness, and serve without needing reward.

Look at those who lived nearest to Him. His Mother. The Apostles. Paul, who did not hide away to enjoy consolations, but poured himself out, weary and awake, working, laboring, carrying the gospel in a body that did not often rest. Contemplation that comes from God does not make us smaller. It makes us braver.

And what joy there is in this: not the joy of ease, but the joy of love that no longer belongs to itself. Fix your eyes on the Crucified One, and you will understand. If He proved His love through labor and suffering, how could we be content to offer Him words only?
