## 69 – Lifted Into Mystery

In these moments of deep prayer, the soul learns things it cannot put into words. It knows God in a way that remains long after the experience has passed.

Even when the mind cannot remember, the heart remembers. Something has been seen. Something has been known. And it quietly changes everything.

This knowing becomes a hidden strength that carries the soul forward.

**Breath Prayer**  
> *Teach me, O Love.*
