## 51 – The Quiet Drift

You may wonder how a soul that loves God can be deceived. And you may wonder how the enemy can enter when a person prays, receives the Sacraments, and lives far from the noise of the world. Yet even among the apostles there was one who listened to the Lord’s own words and still grew cold.

The danger is rarely a sudden fall. It often begins with something that appears harmless—under the pretext of good. A small self-preference. A small excuse. A small turning toward one’s own will. Little by little, the light grows dim, and the heart becomes less supple in God’s hands.

So be gentle, but be awake. Ask for light. Refuse the slow drift. And if God permits temptation, it is not to destroy you, but to strengthen you—so that your love may become steady and your life may help others.

**Breath Prayer**  
> *Keep me awake, Love.*
