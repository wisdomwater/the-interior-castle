## 92 – Loving Without Wages

There are moments when the soul no longer asks what it will receive. Love itself becomes the reason for every offering. To serve the Beloved is enough. Such a heart would gladly pour itself out, even to nothing, if it meant giving Him joy.

These desires do not come from ambition but from tenderness. They rise in souls who have tasted something of God’s beauty and now wish only to belong more fully. Their longing is not for reward but for union.

How gentle God is, to let such small creatures love Him this way. How patient He is, to receive our clumsy devotion and turn it into something radiant.

**Breath Prayer**

 > *I offer myself.*
