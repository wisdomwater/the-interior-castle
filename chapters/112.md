## 112 — Complementary Sisters

Children, prayer is not given so we may feel holy, but so we may love well. Do not imagine there is some easier road than the one Jesus walked. If we wish to welcome Him as our Guest, both Mary and Martha must be present—listening hearts and willing hands together.

Love needs a table as well as a quiet corner. Mary cannot remain at His feet unless Martha brings the bread. In the same way, inner prayer must flow into small acts of care, patience, and courage. This is how we feed the One who lives within us.

Do not seek a path that avoids effort. The deepest union is always woven with ordinary service, and this is not a burden—it is how love stays alive.

**Reflection**  
> *Where might listening and serving meet in your life today?*

**Breath Prayer**  
> *Let my love be whole.*
