## 35 – The Two Fountains

Imagine two fountains filling their basins. One receives water through pipes and aqueducts, with much movement and noise. The other is built near the spring itself and fills silently, as if it were being given rather than gathered.

So it is in prayer. There is a devotion we gain through meditation, effort, and holy thinking. It is good, and it bears fruit. But divine consolations come from the Source itself—God drawing near in a way we cannot produce.

When this water is given, it brings deep peace, a sweetness that rises from within, and it quietly overflows into the whole soul. It does not begin in our striving. It begins in God.
