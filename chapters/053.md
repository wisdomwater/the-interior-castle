## 53 – The Wound of Longing

When a soul has seen its Beloved, even for a moment, it can no longer be satisfied with anything else. A holy ache settles in the heart—a longing to be alone with the One it loves.

God allows this yearning to grow. He does not yet grant the full union, because love must deepen before it can be fulfilled. This waiting is painful, but it is also a gift. It stretches the heart wide enough to receive what is coming.

The soul learns courage here—not the courage of force, but the courage to keep loving while it waits.

**Reflection**  
> *What longing is quietly shaping my heart right now?*

**Breath Prayer**  
> *Come, Beloved.*
