## 23 – Walking Without Clinging

It is not enough to live simply or pray often. What matters is whether the heart is free. A soul may have little and yet still hold tightly; it may appear devout and yet still be afraid to lose anything.

God asks for something quieter and deeper: the willingness to let go, to walk without leaning on possessions, reputation, or even our own carefulness. Love moves more quickly when it is not weighed down by fear.

Do not creep toward God. Trust Him enough to walk.

**Reflection**
> *What are you still holding that makes your steps feel slow?*

**Breath Prayer**
> *“I release.”*
