## 107 — The Temple of Quiet

In this deepest room of the soul, everything is done in peace and silence. God builds this inner temple without noise, without strain, without hurry. The mind does not need to search, because it is already where it belongs. It simply watches, as through a small window, the mystery unfolding within.

There may still be moments when you cannot feel or see what is happening inside, but this does not mean Love has left. The powers of the soul have not been taken away — they are only resting, gently astonished by what they cannot grasp.

Here, the soul does not need ecstasy or rapture. It is content simply to be with God. Nothing startles it anymore, because it has found its true home.
