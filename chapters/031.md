## 31 – The Quiet Spring

There is a way of praying that feels like work, and another that feels like gift. One draws water through effort, gathering it drop by drop with thought and devotion. The other flows silently from a hidden spring, filling the soul without strain.

When God gives this deeper prayer, it brings a stillness that seems to rise from the center of your being. It does not agitate or exhaust you. It soothes, warms, and quietly widens the heart, as if love itself were breathing inside.

Do not try to make this happen. Springs do not come when called—they rise when God wills.
