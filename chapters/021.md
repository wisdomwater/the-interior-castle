## 21 – Peace Without Sweetness

My dear one, do not think your dryness is a failure. Often it is a gift more precious than sweetness. When God withholds consolations, He is not withdrawing love—He is deepening it, teaching the soul to rest in Him without leaning on feeling.

There is a quiet peace that grows when you serve without being paid in delight. It is the peace of humility, the steady joy of a heart that no longer bargains with God but simply belongs to Him.

If you remain faithful here, even without comfort, your soul is learning something truer than pleasure: it is learning trust.
