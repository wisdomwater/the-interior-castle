## 19 – The Honest Heart

I speak to you with tenderness, for I know what it is to look back on wasted time. Yet there is no sorrow so deep that mercy cannot meet it. I have nothing to trust but the kindness of God—and it has never failed me.

You, too, are held by a greater love than your past. You belong to the gentle care of Our Lady and to the mercy of her Son. Let this be your refuge when shame tries to whisper lies about who you are.

Do not be ashamed to come as you are. God already knows—and still He invites you in.
