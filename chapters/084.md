## 84 – When I Lost My Way

There was a time, children, when I thought it wiser to wait only for sweetness in prayer. I did not stay with Jesus in His life and passion. And my soul grew restless, wandering, unable to rest anywhere.

I lost time. I did not grow in love. And only later did I understand why.

Everything good comes through Him. If we leave the path of His humanity, we lose the way itself.

**Breath Prayer**

 > *Through You alone.*
