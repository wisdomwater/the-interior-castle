## 74 – A Glimpse of Home

Sometimes, in this holy flight, the soul is shown a place not of this world—a brightness, a knowing, a peace so different that everything else begins to lose its shine. It is not given to satisfy curiosity, but to strengthen love.

God lets the soul see just enough of where it is going so it can endure where it is. Like travelers carrying a token from home, we walk more bravely once we have glimpsed what awaits us.

After this, many things that once mattered grow strangely quiet. The heart begins to long for only one thing: to belong more fully to the Beloved.

**Reflection**  
> *What has God shown me that makes me less attached to lesser things?*

**Breath Prayer**  
> *Lead me home.*
