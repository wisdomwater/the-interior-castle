## 39 – Stay Near the Source

When God draws a soul close and then it drifts away from prayer, the loss can be great. Like a child leaving its mother’s breast, the soul weakens quickly when it turns from the nourishment that once held it.

Do not be afraid of this truth—let it make you gentle and faithful. Stay near. Return often. Prayer is not a duty here; it is life.

God does not draw you close to abandon you, but to give you more.

**Breath Prayer**
