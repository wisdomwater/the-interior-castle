## 68 – When God Takes the Lead

There are moments when the soul cannot turn away from what God is doing. Love becomes so strong that all other thoughts grow still. The heart is gathered into something greater than itself.

This is not something we can make happen. It is not imagination. It is the touch of the One who holds the whole castle and gently draws the soul into His presence.

Here, all we can do is surrender.

**Reflection**  
> *Where am I being asked to release control and trust God’s leading?*

**Breath Prayer**  
> *I yield to You.*
