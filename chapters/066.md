## 66 – Listening Without Fear

Not every inner voice is from God, but God is not frightened by our caution. When His words are real, they bring humility, courage, and a greater desire to love.

So listen gently. Do not cling. Do not build your life on voices, but on love. Let what is true grow in you without forcing it.

God’s voice never needs to be defended. It carries its own light.
