## 89 – The Light That Arrives Unannounced

Sometimes the Beloved comes so suddenly that the soul has no time to imagine Him. There is a stirring, a trembling, a quiet thunder within, and then—peace. It is not something the mind built. It is a light that simply appears, whole and living, as if the heart had been gently opened from the inside.

What is given this way leaves a different trace. It does not inflate us or leave us grasping for more. It settles us. It plants something steady and true in the center, like a seed of knowing that does not argue for itself. The soul recognizes it, not by sight, but by the way it brings rest and clarity together.

Do not be afraid of the difference between what we imagine and what is given. God is not fragile. When the real Light comes, it does not need defending. It quietly changes us, and that is how we know.

**Reflection**
> *Where in my life have I felt a peace that did not come from my own effort?*

**Breath Prayer**
> *You are here.*
