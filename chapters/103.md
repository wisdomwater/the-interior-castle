## 103 — Filled with God

When the Beloved says, “Go in peace,” the words do not merely pass through the ears — they settle into the center of the soul. A quiet clearing happens there, as though the rooms of the castle are gently emptied of what is restless and heavy. When we let go of what belongs only to the surface of life, the One who is all light finds space to dwell within us.

It is not that we become something grand, but that we become simple. We no longer clutch at what is small, because something vast has made a home in us. The soul begins to discover that it was always meant to be filled with Love itself, not with noise or fear or striving.

In this center place, peace does not need to be defended. It is given. The soul is held so quietly, so tenderly, that even its own thoughts seem to grow still, as though listening.

**Breath Prayer**

 > *Fill me with Your peace.*
