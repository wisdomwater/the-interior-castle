## 13 – When the King Begins to Call

Now we come to the second mansions. Here are souls who have begun to pray and to sense the importance of going farther in. Yet they often lack the strength to leave old occasions of sin behind, and this makes their life uneasy—like someone who has begun to hear music, but cannot yet sing along.

This is the strange mercy of it: the Lord draws near like a loving Neighbor. Even while the soul is still busy with vanities and scattered pleasures, He does not cease to call. His voice comes through sermons, wise words, good books, faithful friends, and sometimes through sickness or sorrow—anything that wakes the heart.

Do not be discouraged if you have not responded quickly. God is patient. If He sees perseverance and good desire, He will wait many days, even many years, because He wants you with Him more than you want yourself healed.
