## 80 – The Tender Weight of Love

Children, when God draws a soul close, sorrow does not disappear—it becomes deeper and gentler. The heart grieves not from fear, but from love, remembering how often it wandered from such goodness.

The sins feel heavy, like stones at the bottom of a river, even while grace rushes above them. Not to condemn the soul, but to keep it humble and grateful.

This sorrow is not meant to crush you. It keeps your love awake.

**Breath Prayer**

 > *Thank You for Your mercy.*
