## 97 – The Soul as a Vast and Holy World

Do not think your soul is small. It is an interior world, wide and luminous, made in the image of God. Within it are many rooms, many hidden chambers, and at the very center a place prepared for the Beloved Himself. When you do not know this, you live as if you were poor, even while you carry a treasure within.

God delights in this inner world. He is not distant from it, nor does He enter reluctantly. He has made a dwelling there for Himself, a second heaven, where He longs to be with you. All of this is already true, even when you do not feel it.

So let your heart grow gentle toward itself. What God has shaped with such care is worthy of reverence.

**Reflection**
> *What would it change if I treated my inner life as a sacred place?*

**Breath Prayer**
> *You dwell in me.*
