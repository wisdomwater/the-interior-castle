## 56 – Light After the Storm

When the soul has been emptied of all its supports, God Himself comes. Often it is through some small word or quiet moment, but suddenly everything changes.

The clouds lift. Peace returns. The heart knows that the victory was not its own. God alone has carried it through.

From this, the soul learns humility and trust that no teaching could give. It knows now that everything depends on mercy.

**Breath Prayer**  
> *You are my help.*
