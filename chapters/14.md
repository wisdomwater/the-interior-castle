## 14 – The Tug of Two Worlds

When the soul begins to move inward, the battle grows louder. The devils do not always appear with darkness; they often arrive dressed as reason. They remind you of the world’s esteem, the comfort you once had, the friends you might lose, the sacrifices that might harm your health—anything to persuade you to turn back.

And so the soul suffers: it does not want to return to the first mansion, yet it trembles to go forward. Memory shows how quickly worldly joys fade—how easily life slips away, how suddenly people disappear, how little remains of what once felt so urgent.

Yet in this turmoil, something steadier rises. The will begins to love the Lord and longs to return love for love. The understanding learns there is no friend like God, no peace like the home within. And reason whispers the truth: outside the castle there is no security—but within, there is a Host who will give you all you truly desire.

**Reflection**
> *What “reasonable” fear might be asking you to turn back, even as love invites you forward?*

**Breath Prayer**
> *“Draw me inward.”*
