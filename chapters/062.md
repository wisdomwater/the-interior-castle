## 62 – Words That Bring Peace

When God truly speaks, something happens. A troubled heart becomes calm. Fear loosens its grip. Light enters where there was confusion.

Even a single phrase from Love can do what no argument can. The soul knows, in a way deeper than thought, that it has been touched by truth.

God’s voice does not argue. It heals.

**Reflection**  
> *What words have brought me unexpected peace?*

**Breath Prayer**  
> *Quiet my heart.*
