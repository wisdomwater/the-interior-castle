## 63 – Walking in Humble Listening

Children, do not be eager for voices or messages. God does not love you more because He speaks to you. He loves you because you are His.

If a word draws you toward humility, kindness, and faithfulness, receive it gently. If it stirs fear or pride, let it pass. We grow safe not by chasing signs, but by walking in love.

Trust grows in quiet obedience.
