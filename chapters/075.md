## 75 – A Heart That Cannot Settle

Children, when the soul has been touched by God in this way, life itself begins to feel too small. Even beautiful things grow thin. Solitude soothes for a moment, yet the longing returns, and the heart feels like a little butterfly that cannot rest.

This pain is not despair—it is love that has outgrown the world. The soul wants only God, and everything else feels like a delay. Even obedience and caution become heavy, because the heart burns so fiercely for the One it loves.

Do not be afraid of this holy ache. It is a sign that love has been awakened.
