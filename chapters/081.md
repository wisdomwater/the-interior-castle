## 81 – Do Not Leave the Human Jesus

Some will tell you that once you have tasted God, you should leave behind the earthly story of Jesus—His life, His wounds, His suffering. Do not believe them, children.

He is the Way. If you let go of Him, you lose your guide. His humanity is not a distraction; it is the doorway into God’s heart.

Look at Him often. Let His face, His steps, His love steady you when your prayer grows thin.

**Breath Prayer**  
> *Lead me, Jesus.*
