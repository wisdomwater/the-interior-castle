## 61 – When God Speaks Softly

Sometimes the Beloved reaches the soul through a word. It may not be heard with the ears, but it is felt deep within. A phrase rises in the heart, quiet and sure, as though spoken by Love itself.

Yet not every word that appears inside us is from God. Some are only the echo of our own thoughts, and some come from weariness or fear. So we listen gently, without clinging.

What matters most is not the sound of the words, but the fruit they leave.

**Reflection**  
> *What inner words have shaped my heart lately?*

**Breath Prayer**  
> *Speak, gentle Love.*
