## 6 – The Gate of the Heart

Some souls live all their days in the outer courtyard of the castle, busy with many things, never quite turning inward. They hear the footsteps of the sentinels but do not ask who lives deeper within. And yet, even there, the light still waits. Nothing has been lost—only forgotten.

The gate into this holy place is simple: it is prayer. Not perfect words, not polished thoughts, but the quiet turning of the heart toward the One who already dwells inside. When you pause, even for a breath, and remember who you are speaking to, the door opens a little.

Do not be afraid if you feel clumsy in this. Even the smallest glance inward is precious. Each time you enter yourself with honesty, you step closer to the center where God is gently shining.

**Breath Prayer**
> *“I turn toward Your light.”*
