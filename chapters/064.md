## 64 – Words That Set the Heart at Rest

When God speaks, children, He does not argue with the soul—He calms it. A single word from Him can quiet a storm no reasoning could still.

“Do not be afraid.” “Be at peace.” “All will be well.” These are not mere sounds. They carry a power that settles the heart and gathers the scattered thoughts back into light.

When such words come, they leave the soul resting, not striving.

**Breath Prayer**

 > *Speak peace, O Love.*
