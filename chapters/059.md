## 59 – The Spark of Fire

From the great fire of God, a small spark sometimes falls into the soul. It warms and brightens the heart, yet does not consume it. The pain is sweet, and the sweetness is deep.

This spark comes and goes as Love chooses. We cannot make it appear, nor can we hold onto it. We can only remain open, letting its warmth do its quiet work.

Even when it fades, the soul remembers the fire.
