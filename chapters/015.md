## 15 – Do Not Turn Back

My dear one, once you have begun to walk inward, the struggle will feel stronger, not weaker. Old habits will tug at you, and the noise of the world will try to call you home again. Yet all of this only means that your soul has begun to wake.

Do not be afraid of the battle. God sees how far you could go, and that is why you are being tested. If you fall, do not despair. Even your stumblings can be turned into stepping-stones when you place them in His hands.

Trust not in your own strength, but in His mercy. He knows how to lead you from one room to another, until the voices that once frightened you grow small and lose their power.
