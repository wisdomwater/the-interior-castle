## 96 – Thirst Between Earth and Heaven

You might wonder why the soul cannot simply quiet itself and submit, as it has before. But in this hour it is no longer mistress of itself. It feels suspended—unable to rest on earth, unable yet to rise into heaven. People may be near, and still everything feels like a shadow beside the absence of the Beloved.

It is a kind of thirst that nothing created can soothe. Not distraction, not companionship, not praise, not rest. The heart wants the living water—and only God can give it. And yet He delays, not to torment, but to enlarge the soul’s capacity for Him.

Even this has mercy in it. The pain purifies, as fire refines gold. Later, when the soul looks back, it understands that this sorrow was not wasted—that it was preparing a wider, cleaner place within for Love to dwell.

**Breath Prayer**
