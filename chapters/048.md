## 48 – The Truth of Small Things

In prayer, it is easy to imagine ourselves brave and generous. We picture great sacrifices and shining virtues. But Love is revealed not in what we imagine, but in how we live.

When small irritations rise, when we are misunderstood or overlooked, that is where our real heart shows itself. These quiet moments teach us who we are becoming.

Do not be troubled by what you see there. Simply let God gently shape you through each small choice.
