## 45 – Soft as Wax in Love’s Hands

The soul, once touched by God, becomes like soft wax. It does not need to shape itself. It only needs to remain open and still so that Love may leave its mark.

God asks for nothing more than our willing. When we give it, He presses His own life into us. Without noise or force, we are quietly made His.

This is how the soul becomes His dwelling. Not by striving, but by yielding. Not by effort, but by trust.

**Reflection**  
> *Where am I being invited to soften and allow Love to shape me?*

**Breath Prayer**  
> *I am Yours.*
