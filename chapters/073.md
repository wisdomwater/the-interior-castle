## 73 – When You Are No Longer Your Own

Children, there comes a moment when the soul feels itself lifted by a power not its own. It is sudden, swift, and at first unsettling. The spirit is drawn upward as though by a strong wind, and the soul realizes it no longer belongs to itself.

Resisting does not stop this movement—it only makes it stronger. So the wisest thing is to surrender, like a small vessel yielding to a great tide. God is teaching the soul that it is held, not by its own strength, but by His.

This kind of being carried can feel frightening, yet it is deeply gentle. The One who lifts you knows exactly where you are being taken.
