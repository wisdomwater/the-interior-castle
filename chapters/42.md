## 42 – The Hidden Butterfly

The soul is like a small silkworm, quietly weaving a little house around itself. It does not know what it is becoming. It simply follows the life placed within it, spinning its thread day by day in simple faithfulness.

Then, in a mystery only God understands, the old form falls away. What was once slow and earthbound is given wings. The soul does not make this happen. It is born into it.

So it is with divine union. We prepare with love and attention, but the transformation is God’s gift. From within the cocoon of prayer, a new life quietly emerges.

**Reflection**  
> *What might be gently unfolding within me, even now?*

**Breath Prayer**  
> *Shape me, O Love.*
