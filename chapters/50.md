## 50 – The Bridegroom’s Visit

There is a kind of union that comes like a brief and secret visit. The soul has already chosen her Beloved. She has resolved—quietly and truly—to please Him, to follow His will, to belong to Him. And the Lord, seeing this desire, draws her close so she may know Him more.

This is not yet the full espousal, but it is a sweet beginning—a betrothal of the heart. In a short moment the soul learns more of her Bridegroom than years of effort could gather. Love teaches her from within.

But, children, these visits are tender. Do not grow careless. Keep your gaze simple. Let nothing else become your treasure, for the soul that turns away from her Beloved loses more than she can imagine.

**Reflection**  
> *What helps me stay faithful to the One I love—especially in small choices?*

**Breath Prayer**  
> *Hold my heart, Lord.*
