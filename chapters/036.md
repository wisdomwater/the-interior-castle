## 36 – Love Without Reaching

You ask, “How shall we receive these graces if we do not try to obtain them?” I tell you, the surest way is humility and love without self-interest. This water does not come because we work harder. It comes because God gives.

The real preparation is not chasing sweetness, but choosing the will of God—desiring to imitate Christ more than to be consoled. We can be saved without special favours, and sometimes the purest love is the love that asks for nothing.

Therefore be at peace. You are His. Let Him do what He wills with you, and lead you where He wills.

> *What would it look like to pray today without reaching for a particular feeling?*

**Breath Prayer**
> *“I am Yours.”*
