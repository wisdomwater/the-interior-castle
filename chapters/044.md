## 44 – The Sweet Ache of Love

When a soul has touched God, it begins to feel a tender ache. It longs for Him, and it grieves when Love is forgotten in the world. This sorrow does not come from fear, but from caring too deeply to look away.

The heart weeps not because it is broken, but because it is open. It feels the beauty of God and the wounds of the world at the same time. This is a holy pain, like being stretched by something greater than ourselves.

Even in this ache, there is peace. The soul knows it belongs to God, even when it does not yet rest fully in Him.
