## 33 – The Way of Humble Love

If you wish to draw near to these hidden waters, do not chase them. Seek only to love. True preparation is not desire for delight, but willingness to suffer with Christ and to live for Him.

Humility opens what effort cannot. God gives Himself not to those who demand, but to those who are ready to receive without claiming.

So keep walking. Love simply. And leave the rest in His hands.

**Reflection**
> *How might loving without expecting change the way you pray?*

**Breath Prayer**
> *“I love without asking.”*
