## 106 — The Love That Stirs Within

When Love lives in the center of the soul, it does not remain silent. It stirs gently, like a small flame rising upward, not by effort but by its own nature. This movement does not come from thinking or remembering — it comes from a deeper place, where God quietly touches the spirit and calls it toward Himself.

Sometimes this touch comes while you are busy or speaking with others. It is a soft inward turning, a tender invitation that says, “Stay with Me.” It is like a secret letter written in the heart, meant for you alone, asking not for many words, but for a simple act of love.

Whenever you feel this inner stirring, know that it rises from the very center of your being, where God has made a home. Even the smallest response — a quiet yes, a breath of love — is enough.

**Reflection**  
> *What gentle invitation might Love be whispering inside you right now?*

**Breath Prayer**  
> *Here I am, Lord.*
