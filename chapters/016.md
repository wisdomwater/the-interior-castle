## 16 – The Way of the Cross

Do not expect sweetness at the beginning of this journey. We bring with us so many fears, habits, and unfinished loves that prayer cannot yet feel simple. But this is not a failure—it is the honest soil where true love grows.

Let your only aim be this: to shape your will into God’s will. Nothing else is more important. When you learn to say yes, even when it is costly, you are already walking in deep prayer.

Do not try to tell God how He should treat you. He knows what will heal you. Carry the cross He gives you today, and you will find it leads not to loss, but to life.

**Breath Prayer**
> *“Your will, my peace.”*
