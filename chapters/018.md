## 18 – Blessed, Yet Still Watching

My dear one, even when you have come far into the castle, there is still no place for careless living. We walk in a beautiful yet fragile land, where love must be guarded and faith kept awake. To belong to God so deeply is a great blessing—and also a tender responsibility.

Do not be troubled by this holy fear. It is not meant to crush you, but to keep your heart turned toward the One who holds you. When we remember how easily we can forget love, we cling more gently and more truly to the One who never forgets us.

Let this reverent watchfulness become a form of prayer. It will keep you close to the center where God quietly waits.

**Breath Prayer**
> *“Keep me close.”*
