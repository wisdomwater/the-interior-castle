## 78 – The Jubilee That Wants Company

Sometimes, children, our Lord gives the soul a strange joy—so deep and clean that it overflows. The faculties remain free, the senses still awake, and yet the whole being rejoices as if it has come home for a moment.

This jubilee cannot stay hidden. The soul wants help to praise God, and it becomes difficult to keep silent—not out of vanity, but out of holy gladness. It is like someone who has found a treasure and cannot bear to celebrate alone.

If God gives you this grace, receive it with gratitude. It is safe and beneficial. And when you are together, let your tongues be used for the best thing: to praise the One who has carried you, kept you, and given you so much.

**Reflection**
> *What is one simple mercy I can name aloud today—without performance—just gratitude?*

**Breath Prayer**
> *Glory to You, Lord.*
