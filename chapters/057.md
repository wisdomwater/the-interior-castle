## 57 – The Wound of Love

Sometimes God calls the soul in a way that cannot be mistaken. Not with words, but with a sudden touch that awakens a deep longing. It feels like a gentle wound, sweet and aching at once.

The soul knows it has been touched by the Beloved, yet cannot hold Him. This makes it cry out, not in fear, but in love. It wishes only to be closer.

This wound hurts—but it is the hurt that heals. One such touch is worth more than many days of ease.

**Reflection**  
> *What longing has God stirred in me that I cannot ignore?*

**Breath Prayer**  
> *Wound me with love.*
