## 99 – God Living Within

In this sacred center, the soul begins to realize something astonishing: God is not only near—He is within. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit make their dwelling in her, not as an idea, but as a living, loving presence. It is not seen with the eyes, but known with a certainty that cannot be shaken.

Even when the light fades and the awareness grows dim, the companionship remains. The shutters may close, but the room is still full. God does not come and go. He abides.

This quiet knowing changes everything. The soul lives differently, not because she tries harder, but because she is no longer alone.

**Reflection**
> *How might I live today if I trusted that God is truly with me?*

**Breath Prayer**
> *Stay with me.*
