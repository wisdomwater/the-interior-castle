## 77 – Tears Are Not the Work

Children, do not think that many tears mean you have finished the path. What matters is the steady work of love: the quiet practice of virtue, the humble doing of what is right. Tears are a mercy, not a trophy.

When God sends them, let them fall like rain from heaven—without forcing them, without measuring them. If you try to dig them up by your own effort, you will only exhaust yourself, and you will not find this living water. But when they come as gift, they soften the hard places and make the soul fertile.

So place yourself before God, simply. Look at His mercy and His greatness, and let Him choose what is best for you—water or dryness. In that surrender, you will have peace.

**Reflection**
> *Where have I been measuring my spiritual life by feelings instead of faithfulness?*

**Breath Prayer**
> *Give what You will.*
