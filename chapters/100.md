## 100 – The Presence That Never Leaves

The light does not always blaze as it did at first. Sometimes the shutters of awareness close, and the radiance grows soft. Yet the One who came does not depart. Even when the brightness fades, the companionship remains, steady and faithful in the center.

This quiet nearness strengthens the heart. It brings a new confidence—not boldness, but trust. The soul begins to sense that it is being prepared for something greater, gently held in a love that will not let go.

What a mercy it is to be accompanied like this, even when it is not felt.

**Breath Prayer**
> *You are with me.*
