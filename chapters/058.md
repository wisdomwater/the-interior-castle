## 58 – The Gentle Wound

Sometimes the Beloved touches the soul without warning. There are no words, no images—only a sudden knowing that Love is near. It feels like a wound, yet it brings no harm. It aches because it awakens a deeper desire to belong.

The heart longs for the One who has touched it. Even though He is already within, the soul yearns to be more fully held. This longing is not restless—it is tender and alive.

Such a wound is not meant to heal. It is meant to keep the heart open.

**Breath Prayer**  
> *Wound me with Love.*
