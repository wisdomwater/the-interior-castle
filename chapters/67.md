## 67 – When Love Makes Us Small

When God draws near, the soul does not grow proud. It grows quiet. It remembers its weakness more clearly and becomes gentler with itself and with others.

True gifts from God do not lift us above one another. They bow us down in gratitude. The more the soul is loved, the less it wishes to be noticed.

This is how Love protects the heart—from turning grace into self-importance.

**Reflection**  
> *How does love make me softer and more humble?*

**Breath Prayer**  
> *Keep me small, O Love.*
