## 50 – The Bridegroom’s Visit

There is a kind of union that comes like a brief and secret visit. The soul has already chosen its Beloved. It has resolved—quietly and truly—to please Him, to follow His will, to belong to Him. And the Lord, seeing this desire, draws it close so it may know Him more.

This is not yet the full espousal, but it is a sweet beginning—a betrothal of the heart. In a short moment the soul learns more of its Bridegroom than years of effort could gather. Love teaches it from within.

But, children, these visits are tender. Do not grow careless. Keep your gaze simple. Let nothing else become your treasure, for the soul that turns away from its Beloved loses more than it can imagine.
