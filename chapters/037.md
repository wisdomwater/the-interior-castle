## 37 – Rest When the King Draws Near

When you come before God, do so like a beggar before a great and generous King. Speak simply, then wait. If He draws you close, be still and receive. If He does not, keep offering your prayer. Either way, He knows what you need.

Do not try to force silence or stillness. God Himself knows when to quiet the mind and when to let it speak. Your task is not to control your soul, but to offer it.

Leave yourself in His hands. That is the truest prayer.
