## 70 – The Room Full of Wonders

Children, I once entered a room filled with countless treasures—glass and porcelain and a thousand delicate things. I stood amazed, yet later I could not recall each object. I only remembered the overwhelming sense of the whole.

So it is when God draws the soul into His inner chamber. Something vast is shown, but not in a way the mind can catalogue. The soul returns with a quiet memory of greatness, even if it cannot explain what it knows.

Do not be troubled by this. What God gives here is not meant to be handled like a list. It is meant to awaken praise.
