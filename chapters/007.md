## 7 – The First Rooms

When a soul first steps inside the castle, the rooms may feel crowded and dim. Old habits, restless thoughts, and small fears still wander about like creatures that do not yet know where they belong. This is not failure. It is simply the beginning.

It is already a grace to be inside. Even if the noise continues, even if the light seems faint, the soul has crossed a sacred threshold. Little by little, the eyes adjust. What once felt overwhelming begins to soften.

Be patient with yourself here. You have not come to be judged but to be welcomed. The rooms will grow quieter as you learn to rest in the Presence that fills the house.
