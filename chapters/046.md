## 46 – The Deeper Union

There is a union even more steady than the sweetness of prayer. It is the quiet joining of our will to God’s will. When this happens, the soul does not need to be lifted into ecstasy to be held by Love—it walks with God through ordinary days.

In this union, nothing can truly disturb the heart. Loss may come, sickness may visit, and yet beneath it all there is a gentle peace, because the soul trusts the wisdom of God more than its own wishes.

This is a hidden grace, but a strong one. It grows wherever the heart keeps choosing love over self.

**Reflection**  
> *Where am I being invited to choose trust over control today?*

**Breath Prayer**  
> *Your will, not mine.*
