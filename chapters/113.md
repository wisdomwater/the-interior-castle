## 113 — Love Made Visible

You may think you cannot lead souls to God because you cannot teach or speak. But you can love, and love is never small. Your humility, your patience, your gentle way of helping one another—these are sparks that quietly set hearts alight.

Do not be distracted by impossible dreams while neglecting the good you can do now. God is pleased when you care for the ones closest to you. Each small kindness becomes a prayer, and each faithful act becomes a light.

What matters most is not how impressive your work seems, but how much love it carries. When you give what you can, God will give the rest.

**Breath Prayer**  
> *Use my love, Lord.*
