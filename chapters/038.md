## 38 – When Love Widens the Heart

When divine consolations come, they do not make the soul smaller or fearful. They enlarge it. Something within grows spacious and free, as if the heart were made to hold more light.

Fear loosens its grip. Suffering feels less threatening. Love grows stronger. And the soul becomes braver in giving itself to God.

These gifts are not meant to be taken lightly. They must be received often, or they fade. The soul is still young and must remain close to the One who feeds it.
