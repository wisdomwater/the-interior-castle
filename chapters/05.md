## 5 - The Gate of Prayer

> *A door that opens softly*

Prayer is simply the way we step inside the castle. It is not about many words or perfect thoughts. It is about turning toward the One who is already near, and letting the heart speak.

Some remain in the courtyard, distracted by many things, forgetting the beauty waiting deeper within. Others, tired of the noise, begin to slip through the gate, unsure but hopeful. Even this small movement is precious to God.

Do not worry if your prayer feels clumsy or scattered. Every honest turning toward Him is already a crossing of the threshold.

**Reflection**  
> *What would it feel like to approach prayer as a gentle return rather than a task?*

**Breath Prayer**  
> *I turn to You.*
