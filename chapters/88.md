## 88 – Gifts Are Not a Ranking

These graces must be kept quiet, not because they are shameful, but because they are tender—and because public talk invites confusion, comparison, and needless pain.

Teresa says something freeing: God guides each soul differently. A striking gift does not mean a holier soul. Sometimes God gives it to the weakest—because they need the help.  

So do not envy what you have not been given, and do not build an identity out of what you have. Look for one thing: the quiet shape of virtue—mortification, humility, single-hearted love.

In the end, the Judge will surprise us all.

**Reflection**  
> *Do I ever compare my path with others—secretly ranking myself above or below?*

**Breath Prayer**  
> *Make me single-hearted.*
