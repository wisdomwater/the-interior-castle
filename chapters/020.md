## 20 – The Gift of Not Owning God

Many souls in these rooms live upright, generous lives. They pray, they serve, they try not to offend God. And this is beautiful. Yet there is a deeper invitation still—to give not only our sins, but our goodness, into God’s hands.

It is easy to begin thinking that our efforts have earned us something. But love does not work by wages. The more we see how much we have received, the more freely we can offer everything back.

Do not count what you have done. Simply place your life again into His care, empty-handed and open-hearted.
