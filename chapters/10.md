## 10 – The Room of Humility

Self-knowledge is precious, but it was never meant to become a small, dark room where you hide. It is only the doorway. True humility is born when you see yourself in the light of God’s goodness, not when you measure yourself by your weakness.

When you look only at your faults, your spirit grows timid and afraid. But when you look at God, something within you rises. You begin to remember who you are and whose you are.

So let your prayer turn outward as well as inward. Gaze upon Christ. Let His gentleness teach you how to be gentle with yourself.

**Reflection**
> *What changes when you see yourself through God’s loving gaze rather than your own?*

**Breath Prayer**
> *“Teach me Your humility.”*
