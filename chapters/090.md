## 90 – Walking in the Light With Another

When such moments come, the soul should not walk alone. God, in His kindness, places companions along our way—those who listen, who help us stay rooted, who guard us from drifting into our own wishes. To be open with them is not a weakness. It is a form of trust.

Speak simply about what stirs in your prayer, not to be judged, but to remain grounded. Even if what you experienced was not pure, humility will turn it toward good. The heart that stays honest cannot be truly harmed.

If something comes from God, it will grow into love, patience, and quiet courage. Time will reveal it. There is no rush. The Light does not flee when we look at it gently.

**Breath Prayer**
