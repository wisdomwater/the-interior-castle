## 55 – When Even God Feels Far Away

There are hours, children, when the soul cannot find God anywhere. Words about Him feel like stories from long ago. Prayer sounds empty. The heart wonders if it has ever loved at all.

This is not a fall from grace, though it feels like one. It is a holy darkness where all human strength is taken away. The soul learns, not by thought but by experience, how helpless it is without God.

Even here, Love has not withdrawn. He is working in ways too deep to feel.

**Reflection**  
> *What do I do when God feels distant and my heart is tired?*

**Breath Prayer**  
> *Stay with me, Love.*
