## 8 – The Hidden Sun

Even when the soul feels dark or confused, the light at its center has not gone out. It may be covered, like a crystal wrapped in cloth, but the sun still burns brightly within. God has not withdrawn. Only our awareness has grown dim.

When we forget ourselves or wander far from love, we do not lose our sacredness. We lose sight of it. Yet the Living Light remains, waiting patiently for us to turn back and feel its warmth again.

So do not despair when you feel far away. The heart of the castle is nearer than your next breath. You are always being held from the inside.
