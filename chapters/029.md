## 29 – Love Is Not a Feeling

Love does not consist in always thinking of God or in feeling sweet devotion. Love is the steady choice to please Him, to avoid what harms that love, and to desire His glory more than our own comfort.

When your thoughts wander, do not despair. Your will can still be fixed on God even while your imagination roams. A mother may watch her child while the child plays in many places—love remains.

Do not measure your prayer by how focused you feel, but by how willing you are to give yourself.

**Reflection**
> *How do you show love when feelings are quiet or scattered?*

**Breath Prayer**
> *“I choose You.”*
