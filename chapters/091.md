## 91 – Choosing the Way of Trust

Do not seek special visions or rare graces. Love does not need spectacle. The deepest work of God happens in ordinary faithfulness, in the slow shaping of a willing heart. To want extraordinary things is often just another way of not trusting the path we are on.

The Beloved knows what each soul can bear. Some are given bright consolations, others a quieter road. Both lead to the same center. What matters is not the form of the gift, but the love with which we receive what is given.

Place yourself in His hands. Let Him decide how He will meet you. This surrender is already a kind of vision.

**Reflection**
> *What would it feel like to trust the path I am on right now?*

**Breath Prayer**
> *Your will, my peace.*
