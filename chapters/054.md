## 54 – When Love Is Misunderstood

Those who walk closely with God are often misunderstood. Even those who once felt like friends may turn away. They may say you are deceived, or strange, or trying to be more than you are.

This wounds deeply. Yet the soul that belongs to God learns to rest in something steadier than human opinion. Praise and blame begin to lose their power, because the heart knows that whatever is good comes from God alone.

In this quiet place, humility is born. The soul becomes small and free, content to let God be known, even if it is hidden or misjudged.
