## 60 – The Fragrance of His Nearness

At times the Beloved makes Himself known like a sudden fragrance filling the air. Nothing is seen or heard, yet the soul knows He is near. This scent stirs deep joy and a desire to praise.

There is no pain here, only a gentle drawing toward Love. The heart becomes light, ready to serve, ready to adore.

These gifts do not come from imagination. They leave the soul humbler, more willing to suffer for Love, more free from the world.

**Reflection**  
> *When have I quietly sensed God’s nearness without words?*

**Breath Prayer**  
> *Stay with me, Beloved.*
