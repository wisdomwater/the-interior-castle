## 98 – The Presence Chamber

When the soul has been made ready by love and longing, God leads it into His presence chamber. This is not a moment of ecstasy that carries it away, but a quiet entrance into the deepest center where He waits. Here the union is not something that passes. It becomes a way of being.

Before, God would touch only the highest part of the soul. Now He gathers the whole being into Himself. It is no longer only lifted toward Him—it is drawn into where He already dwells.

This is the grace of spiritual marriage: not a visit, but a homecoming.
