## 11 – The Subtle Work of Love

In these first rooms of the castle, much is still unsettled. Old habits, distractions, even very sincere desires can become tangled. Not everything that feels holy leads us closer to love.

Sometimes great zeal hides a small lack of gentleness. Sometimes discipline forgets compassion. The Spirit does not rush or bruise the heart—He leads quietly, with patience and light.

Stay near Christ. Let His way become your way. Where love deepens, you are safe.
