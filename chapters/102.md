## 102 – One With the Living God

Spiritual union becomes something far deeper here—not a visit, not a passing closeness, but a true joining. Like rain falling into a river, the two become one flow. God and the soul are not confused, yet they are no longer separate.

This oneness is not felt as excitement, but as life itself. The heart knows it is being held, animated, sustained from within. Love no longer comes and goes—it abides.

This is why peace settles so deeply here. The soul has not found God. It has discovered that God has found it.
