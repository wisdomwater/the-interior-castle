## 79 – The Sorrow That Comes From Love

You might think that a soul who has tasted God so closely would stop mourning past sins. But, children, it is often the opposite. The more grace is given, the more the heart feels its former ingratitude—not with despair, but with a tender grief that says, “How could I have wandered so far from such a King?”

This sorrow is not chiefly fear of punishment. It is love awakening to what it once did not see. The sins feel like mud in the riverbed—while God’s mercy rushes like a swift stream above them. The mercy is stronger, yet the memory remains, not to crush you, but to keep you humble and thankful.

So do not forget where you were brought from. Let remembrance become reverence. And let your deepest dread be only this: to lose your love, to drift from His hand, to return to the old small life.

**Reflection**
> *When I remember my past, can I let it move me toward humility and gratitude instead of shame?*

**Breath Prayer**
> *Hold me near, Jesus.*
