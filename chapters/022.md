## 22 – When Trials Reveal Us

Some souls live well-ordered lives for many years, yet small trials undo them. This is not to shame them, but to show them the truth: we do not know ourselves until we are gently tested.

When difficulties come, we discover where we still cling, where we still depend on ourselves. This can be painful—but it is also merciful. God is not exposing us to condemn us, but to heal us.

Let every trial become a mirror, not a verdict. What you see is simply where love still wants to grow.

**Reflection**
> *What has a recent trial revealed about your heart?*

**Breath Prayer**
> *“Show me gently.”*
