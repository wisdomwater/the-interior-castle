## 72 – The Fruit That Remains

After such a grace, the soul longs to serve. It wishes it had a thousand lives to spend for God. It grows eager for sacrifice—not from harshness, but from love that wants to give itself away.

Yet the soul also feels tenderly exposed. If others notice these workings of God, it fears misunderstanding. Even so, the Lord comforts it: people may praise God or criticize you—either way, He will guard what is His.

So be courageous, children. Seek God, not reputation. Let your only aim be to please the One who holds your soul as His own.

**Reflection**  
> *What would change if pleasing God mattered more to me than being understood?*

**Breath Prayer**  
> *Be my only aim.*
