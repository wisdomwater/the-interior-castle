## 65 – The Certainty That Remains

God’s words do not fade like ordinary speech. They stay, bright and steady, even when everything seems to contradict them.

Years may pass. Circumstances may look impossible. Still the heart quietly knows that what Love has spoken will somehow be fulfilled.

This certainty is not stubbornness. It is trust born of having been touched by truth.

**Breath Prayer**

 > *I trust You.*
