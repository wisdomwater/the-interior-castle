## 71 – The Doors Close, and Love Takes Over

When the Bridegroom wishes, He closes the doors of the castle. Speech fails. The senses grow still. The body may even become cold, as though the soul had slipped away for a moment.

Yet this is not emptiness. The spirit is never more alive than here. God holds the soul in a joy so full that it is like holy inebriation—an intoxication that leaves the will burning with love.

And when the soul returns, it is ashamed only of one thing: how little it has loved, and how small its offering still feels.

**Reflection**  
> *Where do I resist being carried by God because I want to stay in control?*

**Breath Prayer**  
> *Carry me, Beloved.*
