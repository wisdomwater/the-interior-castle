## 24 – Love Is the True Measure

My dear one, do not be troubled if sweetness is rare and prayer feels dry. Consolations are not the measure of love. Love is shown not by what you feel, but by how freely you give yourself to God when nothing is given back.

How little anything we do can ever repay such a Love as His. He created us, sustains us, and even chose to serve us in His earthly life. To offer Him our simple faithfulness is already more than we deserve to give.

If dryness humbles you and makes you gentler, it has done its holy work. Peace born of humility is worth far more than delight that leaves the heart unchanged.

**Reflection**
> *How might God be loving you even in the absence of sweetness?*

**Breath Prayer**
> *“I love You still.”*
