## 40 – The Certainty That Remains

Sometimes a child is lifted so deep into God that all the senses fall quiet. There is no seeing, no hearing, no grasping—only being. When the soul returns, it carries a knowing that cannot be shaken. Years may pass, but this knowing remains like a light that never goes out.

This is how the Lord teaches without words. Not through pictures or ideas, but through a deep touch at the center. The heart knows it was held. Even if the mind cannot explain how, the soul remembers that it rested inside God and that God rested inside it.

Do not trouble yourself about how this happens. It is enough to know that Love has visited you. The work belongs to God alone. Our part is simply to remain open, humble, and grateful when it comes.
