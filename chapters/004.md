## 4 - The Room at the Center

In the very middle of this great castle there is a room where God and the soul speak in secret. It is not loud or dramatic. It is still, gentle, and full of light. All the other rooms exist only to lead us there.

Many of us spend our lives wandering the outer halls, busy and distracted, unaware that something sacred is happening deep within us. Yet God never leaves that inner chamber. He waits patiently, not for perfection, but for attention.

You do not have to force your way into this center. You only have to turn toward it. Even a small turning begins the journey home.

**Breath Prayer**

 > *Lead me inward.*
