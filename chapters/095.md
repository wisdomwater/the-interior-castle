## 95 – The Wound That Turns the Soul to Ash

Sometimes love strikes so deeply that the earthly part of us seems to crumble. In that moment the soul cannot even remember itself. The powers within are held fast, and the only thing left is a painful awareness of distance—how far we still are from the One we love.

This suffering is not like bodily pain. It reaches into the innermost room, where no one else can follow. And because God allows the soul to sense His nearness more vividly, the ache grows sharper—not because He is cruel, but because love recognizes what it longs for, and the longing becomes unbearable.

Do not think I speak in extremes. Words cannot carry the weight of this experience. I only know that the soul learns something here: love is real, and separation hurts because union is what we were made for.
