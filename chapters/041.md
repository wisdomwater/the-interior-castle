## 41 – The Cellar of Love

The Beloved brings the soul into a hidden room deep within, a place of rich and quiet delight. This is not somewhere we walk into by effort. We may search the streets for God, but only God can carry us into this inner cellar where love is poured without measure.

In this place, all striving stops. The doors of the senses fall closed, and yet the soul is more awake than ever. God enters without knocking, just as Christ passed through walls to greet His friends with peace.

All that is asked of us is a gentle yielding. We do not open the door—Love does. We simply let ourselves be found.

**Reflection**  
> *Where am I being invited to stop striving and let myself be led?*

**Breath Prayer**  
> *Lead me, Love.*
