## 101 – Two Movements, One Life

It may seem strange that part of the being can be at peace while another part is busy, strained, or weary. Yet this is how it often is. There is a deep center that remains still, even while the outer life moves through effort and sorrow.

The inner self rests in God, while the daily self labors. Both belong to the same life, yet they do not always feel the same. This is not confusion—it is the gentle mystery of how we are held.

To know this is a comfort: even when everything feels unsettled, something within remains at home.
