## 111 — Mary and Martha Together

This is the aim of prayer: that its children be good works. A soul may feel very recollected in solitude, and make many promises there—but when the moment comes, love must take flesh. The surest sign that these favors are from God is that they bear fruit in how we live, how we help, how we choose, how we endure.

Do not imagine that later, when one is “advanced,” one may rest outwardly. The rest is within. The soul does not send these inner messages to lull the castle to sleep. No—this deep union becomes a stronger battleground of love. From the center, the soul rouses the powers and even the body, urging them to fidelity, patience, humility, and service.

So lay a firm foundation: be glad to be the least, ready to be a servant, attentive to how you can help. Prayer without virtue remains small. But when humility and love become your ground, the castle stands on rock, and nothing can easily bring it down.

**Reflection**  
> *How could your inner prayer quietly become help for someone around you today?*

**Breath Prayer**  
> *Make my love practical.*
