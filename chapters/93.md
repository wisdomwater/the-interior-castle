## 93 – Living Within the Great Palace

One day the soul is shown a simple, overwhelming truth: we never step outside of God. We live and move within Him, as if within a vast and luminous palace. Every breath, every thought, every act happens inside His presence.

This realization humbles us. We begin to see how gently God bears with us, even when we forget Him. Nothing we do escapes His nearness, and yet He does not withdraw His love. Instead, He waits, steady and patient, for us to turn back toward Him.

To remember this is not to feel afraid, but to feel held. We are already home, even when we wander.

**Reflection**
> *What would it change if I remembered I am always held in God’s presence?*

**Breath Prayer**
> *I am in You.*
