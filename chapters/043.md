## 43 – The Butterfly Emerges

After the soul has been hidden in God, it comes forth changed. What was once heavy now feels light. What once crawled now longs to fly. Even a brief resting in Love leaves the heart unlike what it was before.

The soul looks at itself and hardly recognizes who it has become. It is not proud of this, only amazed. It knows this beauty is not its own, yet it carries it gently, as a butterfly carries its wings.

From this place, everything earthly feels strangely thin. The soul does not despise the world, but it has tasted something deeper and now walks with a quieter hunger.

**Breath Prayer**

 > *Let me rise, O Love.*
