## 114 — Walking the Castle

This interior castle is always open to you. You may walk through it at any hour, even when the outer world is loud or demanding. You cannot force your way into its deepest rooms, but you can wait there humbly until Love opens the door.

Each room holds beauty, each passage holds grace. When you are called away by the duties of your life, do not fear—you will always be welcomed back. The One who lives at the center keeps the door open for you.

If anything in these pages has helped you know God more tenderly, it is His gift. Walk gently. Stay humble. And let your whole life become a quiet hymn of praise.

**Reflection**  
> *What room of your inner castle feels most alive to you right now?*

**Breath Prayer**  
> *Draw me home, Lord.*
