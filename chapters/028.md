## 28 – When God Widens the Heart

There is a joy that comes from our own effort in prayer, and there is another joy that comes as a gift from God. The first is sweet, like a warm feeling after good work. The second is deeper—it opens the heart in a way we could never make for ourselves.

Do not be afraid if what you feel is small or ordinary. What matters is not the size of the sweetness, but whether God is quietly enlarging your capacity to love. When He does, you may not even know how it happened—only that you are more open, more gentle, more alive.

Trust that God knows how to reach you. He gives when and how He wills, and His gifts never wrong anyone.
