## 49 – The Union That Looks Like Love

Children, do not think union with God is found in holding still, or guarding a fragile sweetness, as though devotion were a delicate glass that will shatter if you breathe. The Lord does not ask you to preserve feelings. He asks you to love.

If you can relieve a friend who is ill, do it without fear. If they are in pain, let your heart feel with them. If there is food to be shared, let them be fed. This does not steal your prayer—this *is* your prayer, because it joins your will to the will of God.

Rejoice when others are praised. Be glad when a friends’s goodness is seen. Cover their weakness with mercy, as you would wish your own to be covered. This is the true path into the center.

**Reflection**  
> *What simple act of love is God placing in my hands today?*

**Breath Prayer**  
> *Make love my prayer.*
