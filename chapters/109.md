## 109 — A Holy Fear That Keeps Us Awake

Sometimes the creatures from the moat rise up again — old habits, old anxieties, old impulses — as if they want to reclaim what they once ruled. It may only last a day, or a little more, but it is enough to remind the soul of what a gift it is to live in such holy Company. And when this shaking comes, the soul learns—not by panic, but by contrast—how much it is being held.

These brief disturbances are not meant to crush you. They are permitted so you remember your natural weakness and stay humble, tender, and awake. Even when the soul is tried, it does not turn away from God. Its will does not secretly drift back toward its old life. The trial, instead of undoing the soul, tightens the knots of love and strengthens its quiet resolve.

So do not be shocked by your frailty. Let it teach you gentleness. Let it make you pray, not with dread, but with a grateful seriousness: “Lord, keep me. Do not let me offend You.” For this, truly, is our safest place.

**Breath Prayer**

 > *Keep me faithful, Lord.*
