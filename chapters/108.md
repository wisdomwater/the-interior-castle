## 108 — A Peace That Stays

This peace the soul receives is real, though it still walks through a fragile world. It knows how much it could lose, and so it grows gentle and careful, not from fear, but from love. The more it has been given, the more humbly it holds itself.

Sometimes the soul longs to be safely beyond all change, yet at once it remembers why it remains — to love, to serve, to let God be known through its small life. Even its heaviness becomes light, because it is carried in God’s presence.

Troubles may rise like waves, but they pass quickly. The calm returns, not because life is easy, but because Love lives within. And where Love is, peace will always find its way back.

**Reflection**  
> *What might change if you trusted that peace can return, even after a storm?*

**Breath Prayer**  
> *Keep me in Your peace.*
