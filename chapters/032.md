## 32 – The Fragrance Within

When divine consolations are given, the soul senses something delicate and holy—like a hidden fire, like a gentle fragrance rising from deep within. You cannot see it, and you cannot make it appear, yet it leaves you changed.

It does not belong to imagination or effort. It comes from God alone. And when it is real, it leaves behind a softness, a longing to love, and a quiet strength that remains after the feeling has passed.

Do not worry if you cannot explain it. Love does not need to be understood to be true.

**Breath Prayer**

 > *“Your love remains.”*
