## 87 – Seek Light, Then Rest

At the beginning, it is wise to seek counsel. Not because God is cruel or distant, but because we are human—and fear can twist even a good gift into torment.

Tell it simply, under confession if needed, to someone steady: a wise theologian, a spiritual guide, or—best of all—someone who is both learned and tender. And if they call it “fancy,” do not panic. If it is fancy, it will not ruin you. If it is God, He will not abandon you.

After you have sought counsel, let yourself rest. Do not keep reopening the wound with endless checking. Scruples can become their own prison.

**Reflection**  
> *Where do I keep circling the same fear instead of entrusting it to God?*

**Breath Prayer**  
> *Give me holy peace.*
