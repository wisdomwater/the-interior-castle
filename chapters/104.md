## 104 — The Quiet Center

When the soul is drawn into God’s own dwelling within, something remarkable happens: the storms may still rage in the outer rooms, but the center remains calm. Thoughts, worries, and emotions may pass through the halls of the castle, yet they do not disturb the place where Love is seated.

It is like a great palace in the middle of a troubled land. Voices shout at the gates, but the throne room remains still. The soul learns that it can feel sorrow and fatigue — and yet, at the same time, be deeply at rest.

This peace is not numbness. It is a living, breathing presence that stays even when the body aches or the mind is troubled. The soul knows, quietly, that it is held.

**Breath Prayer**

 > *Hold me in Your center.*
