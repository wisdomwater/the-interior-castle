## 86 – The Fruit Tells the Tree

If this grace leaves you more humble, more careful not to wound Love, more attentive to God’s presence, and less interested in being “somebody,” then you need not live in dread.  

Teresa is not telling us to chase experiences. She is telling us to watch the *fruit*. The enemy can mimic sensations for a moment, but he cannot sustain a long work of peace that steadily bends the will toward God. He does not patiently build a soul into charity.

So do not measure yourself by the extraordinary. Measure yourself by the ordinary: how you love, how you serve, how quickly you return when you fall.

**Reflection**  
> *What fruit is my prayer producing lately—peace, humility, patience, charity?*

**Breath Prayer**  
> *Let my life bear fruit.*
