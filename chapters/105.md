## 105 — Living for Love

When the soul has truly come to rest in God, it begins to forget itself. Not in a sad or empty way, but in the way a child forgets themselves while gazing at something beautiful. Life is no longer about being noticed, but about letting Love move freely through every small act.

Even the longing for heaven grows softer. The heart does not hurry to leave this world, because it has already found God here. What it longs for now is simply to serve, to love, and to let every breath quietly honor the One who dwells within.

Suffering may still come, but it no longer tastes bitter. Even hardship becomes another way to be near Love. And when others wound the soul, compassion rises instead of anger, because the heart has been made wide.
