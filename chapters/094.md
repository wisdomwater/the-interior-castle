## 94 – Walking in Truth

In a brief, quiet flash, the soul is shown that God is Truth itself. Not an idea, not a rule, but a living clarity in which all things are seen as they truly are. Compared to this light, our half-truths and self-deceptions feel thin and fragile.

From this gift grows a deep love for humility—not the kind that shrinks, but the kind that stands honestly before God and others. To be humble is simply to be real: to know what is ours and what is God’s, and not to confuse the two.

The more gently we live in this truth, the freer we become. Nothing needs to be pretended. Everything can rest in the light.

**Reflection**
> *Where am I invited to be more gently honest—with myself or with God?*

**Breath Prayer**
> *Let me be true.*
