## 27 – The Gentle Beginning of Mystery

Now, my children, we come near to rooms where the light is softer and deeper. What happens here cannot be explained well—only lived. God begins to touch the soul in ways that are not of our own making.

Do not seek these graces. Simply remain faithful. They come when God wishes, and always for love.

If your thoughts wander, do not be afraid. The King is closer than your distraction.
