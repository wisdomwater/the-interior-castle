## 17 – The Quiet Fire of Prayer

Prayer is not an escape from your life—it is the place where your life is gently gathered and made whole. When you return to the center, even briefly, something in you remembers who you are.

If distractions come, begin again. If dryness comes, begin again. Recollection is not learned by force but by kindness, as one might train a small child to come home.

Look often toward Christ. Think of what He has given you. Let that remembrance kindle love. From love, all strength will quietly rise.
