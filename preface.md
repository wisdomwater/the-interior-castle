## Preface

St. Teresa of Ávila wrote The Interior Castle in the late sixteenth century, not as a work of abstract theology, but as an act of obedience, love, and lived experience. Asked by her superiors to describe the path of prayer, she reached for the language that came most naturally to her—not technical terms or rigid systems, but images drawn from the soul itself. What emerged was a vision both simple and inexhaustible: the human person as a luminous castle, filled with many rooms, all centered around a radiant presence where God dwells.

Teresa was not writing for scholars alone. She wrote for seekers. For ordinary people who sensed that God was nearer than they had been taught to believe, yet struggled to articulate that nearness. Her castle became a map for mystics across centuries—guiding contemplatives, reformers, doubters, and lovers of God through the gradual awakening of the soul. Again and again, her work has reassured readers that holiness is not reserved for the extraordinary few, but unfolds through attention, humility, courage, and love.

This retelling is offered in that same spirit. I have sought to preserve Teresa’s heart and imagery while rendering her words in a modern voice—one that feels accessible, warm, and close at hand. The text is arranged as daily readings, meant not to be hurried through, but lingered with. Teresa herself cautioned against rushing the journey. Growth in prayer, she insisted, happens through savoring, not striving.

May these pages invite you inward. May Teresa’s images spark your imagination and give language to movements you may already sense within yourself. And may this slow walk through the rooms of the soul draw you—gently, patiently, and truly—closer to the heart of God, who has never been far from you at all.

Walking towards His chamber,

Michael
