## About This Project

*The Interior Castle* was written in the 16th century as a spiritual guide to the interior life—an invitation to explore the soul’s journey toward union with God. Teresa’s metaphor of the soul as a many-roomed castle offers a map of prayer that is both practical and mystical. It has guided countless seekers through quiet rooms of awareness, patience, and deeper intimacy with the divine.

This edition reshapes Teresa’s work into **daily readings** with a contemporary voice that seeks to warm the heart and invite presence. Each day contains a modern retelling followed by a short **breath prayer**—a simple centering practice to ground the mind and quiet the spirit.

## Structure

The text is organized as:

* **Daily readings** (Day 1–Day 30/40/…)  
* Each day includes:  
  * A short, evocative passage drawn from Teresa’s castle imagery  
  * A gentle breath prayer meant to center the mind  
* The full text is framed by:  
  * A **Preface** (context and invitation)  
  * An **Epilogue** (encouragement for continued inward journey)

This structure encourages slow, reflective reading rather than hurried completion.

## How to Read

This is not a book to rush through.

You are encouraged to:

* Read **one day at a time**
* Sit with the images that arise
* Return to days that resonate deeply
* Let silence and breath do part of the work

The text is designed to be companionable, not conclusive—*an invitation to interior presence rather than mere information*.

---

## Faithfulness and Approach

* Faithful to Teresa’s meaning, metaphors, and lived experience of prayer  
* Rendered in modern, heart-warming language  
* No academic commentary or critical apparatus  
* Rooted in contemplative practice, not theology alone

This is not a replacement for Teresa’s original text. It is an *invitation to listen*—to sit with her imagery and breathe into the stillness she describes.

## A Final Word

If you find yourself asking:

* What does prayer feel like at the center of the soul?
