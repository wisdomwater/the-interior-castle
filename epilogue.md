## Epilogue

#### *A Blessing for the Journey Inward*

If you have walked this far, know that you have not reached an ending, but a threshold.

St. Teresa of Ávila never intended The Interior Castle to be mastered or completed. It was meant to be entered, wandered through, returned to again and again. The rooms of the soul do not unfold all at once, nor do they open by force. They reveal themselves slowly, through love, patience, and a willingness to remain present.

Prayer, as Teresa understood it, is not escape from the world but a deeper inhabiting of reality. It is learning to stay—when thoughts wander, when silence feels empty, when progress seems unclear. Every honest turning inward, no matter how small, is already a movement toward God, who has been dwelling at the center all along.

As you close this book, may you continue the practice it has invited. Set aside moments of quiet. Return to the breath. Speak simply. Listen gently. Trust that nothing sincere is wasted. The castle is not behind you now—it is within you, waiting in stillness, light upon light.

Go gently. Go inward. And may the One who dwells at the heart of your soul meet you there with patience, tenderness, and unending love.
